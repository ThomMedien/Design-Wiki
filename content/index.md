title: Welcome to my design wiki - Plan for these notes
---
Potentially pay for device syncing of notes, at the least create a similar Hugo website/ wiki synced/ linked to the obsidian folder with all my Media design notes and information, just as a place to keep my notes and information. 

I will be taking notes on information from school, and my apprenticeship as well as other things that are important to my career progression

To do: 
link gemini cli to obsidian, 
link obsidian to a new website
