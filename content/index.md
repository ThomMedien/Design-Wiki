title: Welcome to the Digital Design Wiki
---
This is a central space to catch and organize the massive amount of digital design knowledge scattered across the web. The industry moves fast, so this wiki acts as a persistent home for the patterns, principles, and systems that actually matter.

It’s meant to be a utility—not just a collection of links. If you’ve got something to add or see a gap that needs filling, contributions are more than welcome.
