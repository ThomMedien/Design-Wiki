A tech stack is the combination of technologies that a company uses to build and run an application or project. It's the collection of programming languages, frameworks, libraries, and other tools that developers use.

For a media designer, a "tech stack" might not be in the traditional sense of a software developer, but it would refer to the primary software and tools you use to create and manage your work.
