# Grid and Composition

**Definition:** A grid is a system for organizing layout. It's a framework of lines, either vertical or horizontal, that helps to align and arrange elements in a design. Composition is the arrangement of these elements in a way that is visually pleasing and effectively communicates a message.

**Importance in Design:**
Grids bring order and structure to a design, making it easier for users to navigate and consume information. Good composition is essential for creating a balanced and harmonious design that guides the user's eye and creates a clear focal point. Together, grids and composition are the backbone of a strong and effective design.
