# Colour Palettes

**Definition:** A colour palette is the set of colours chosen for a design. It can be composed of a few colours or a wide range of colours, and it's used to create a cohesive and harmonious look and feel.

**Importance in Design:**
Colour is a powerful tool in design that can be used to evoke emotions, create a visual identity, and draw attention to important elements. A well-defined colour palette helps to maintain consistency across a design and can significantly impact the user's perception of a product or brand.
