It involves selecting typefaces, point sizes, line lengths, line-spacing (leading), and letter-spacing (tracking), and adjusting the space between pairs of letters (kerning).

**Importance in Design:**
Typography is a fundamental component of design. It establishes the visual hierarchy of a design, guiding the reader through the content. The choice of typeface can significantly influence the tone and mood of a design, and proper typography can enhance readability and user experience.
